#![no_std]
//! Governance Contract with Enhanced Quadratic Voting
//!
//! This contract implements a sophisticated quadratic voting mechanism where:
//! - The cost of casting N votes is N² (quadratic cost)
//! - Users have voting credits that limit their total voting power
//! - Proposals require quorum to pass
//! - Mathematical accuracy is ensured through careful integer operations
