# AnchorPoint Backend

The backend service for AnchorPoint, providing API endpoints for Stellar Anchor operations as per SEPs 1, 10, 12, and 24.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for robustness.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework.
- **Jest & Supertest**: Testing framework and HTTP assertion library.
- **ESLint**: Linter for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation
From the monorepo root:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

Or from the `/backend` directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
To start the development server with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building
To compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing
To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To run tests with coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Current coverage threshold is set to **95%** for branches, functions, lines, and statements.

### Quality Control
To run the linter:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Database Restore Verification
To verify that the SQLite backend database can be backed up and restored without mutating the source database:
```bash
npm run db:restore:verify
```

For the full disaster recovery procedure, see [Database Restore Disaster Recovery Runbook](./docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY_DB_RESTORE.md).

## External KYC Providers (SEP-12)
AnchorPoint supports pluggable third-party KYC providers for SEP-12 flows.

Supported providers:
- `mock` (default)
- `persona`
- `shufti`

Configuration:
- `KYC_PROVIDER=mock|persona|shufti`
- `KYC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<shared secret for webhook signature validation>`
- `PERSONA_API_KEY=<persona api key>`
- `PERSONA_API_URL=<optional, defaults to https://withpersona.com/api/v1>`
- `SHUFTI_CLIENT_ID=<shufti client id>`
- `SHUFTI_SECRET_KEY=<shufti secret key>`
- `SHUFTI_API_URL=<optional, defaults to https://api.shuftipro.com>`

Webhook endpoint:
- `POST /sep12/webhook`

Provider webhook updates are validated by signature and then reconciled against either provider reference or account.
## Admin Password Reset
AnchorPoint backend includes a secure password reset flow for admin users.

Endpoints:
- `POST /api/admin/password-reset/request`
- `POST /api/admin/password-reset/confirm`

Security behavior:
- Email-based verification token delivery
- Tokens are random 256-bit values and only a hashed token is stored
- Tokens expire after `PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_MINUTES` (default: 15)
- Tokens are single-use and outstanding tokens are invalidated on new requests
- Request endpoint returns a non-enumerating success message even for unknown emails

Optional SMTP environment variables:
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `SMTP_FROM`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET_URL_BASE`

When SMTP is not configured, emails are logged locally for development instead of being sent.

## SMTP Integration
The backend uses a shared Nodemailer transport (`src/lib/smtp.service.ts`) for:
- Admin password reset emails
- User notification emails (when SMTP is configured)
- Hot wallet low-balance alerts

Configure the SMTP variables above to enable delivery in staging or production.
When SMTP is configured, the backend also sends HTML alert emails (for example hot-wallet low-balance notifications) using the same transport. Set `ALERT_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` to a comma-separated list of operator addresses. If SMTP is not configured, alert content is logged at `info` level for local development.
